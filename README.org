#+title: README for the dotfiles repository.
#+author: Arnav Andrew Jose

This repository is a literate store of the dotfiles I use in my daily work.
Currently that consists of:

- emacs
- zsh

I prefer to use .zshenv for my zsh config
and the .emacs.d dir for the emacs config.

Run M-x org-babel-tangle-file in the org file of your choice to
populate the config files with my setup.

Pull requests are welcome for any enhancements or bugfixes.
